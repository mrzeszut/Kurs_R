abstract = {Atmospheric dispersion pollution modelling is of great and actual concern in the scientific international community. Many dispersion models have been developed and used to estimate the downwind ambient concentration of air pollutants from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical release. Among them, Gaussian model is perhaps the most commonly used model type. It is often used to predict the dispersion of air pollution plumes originated from ground-level or elevated sources. In this research an experimental campaign was carried out in the wind tunnel of the Industrial Engineering Department of University of Catania. It was tested an emission plume of particulate matters and the concentrations of PM10 were evaluated in several points downwind beyond the emitter. Both the wind velocity and PM10 mass flow were varied in order to test the differences in terms of PM10 concentrations in the sampling points. A Gaussian plume mathematical model was developed according the boundaries conditions of the experimental campaign. The results of the model were compared with experimental ones in order to identify the limits and the advantages of this model in such a small scale system.},

abstract = {Air quality impact assessment is usually carried out with the application of simplified stationary dispersion models, which omit the chemical transformation process of air pollutants. Omission of this effect in the calculation process increases the uncertainty of the obtained results, and hinders the decision making process, related to air quality management. The paper presents a comparison of atmospheric dispersion modeling related to pollutants emitted from high industrial emitters, performed with and without consideration of various chemical transformation modules pertaining to the formation of inorganic aerosols, available in the CALMET/CALPUFF modeling system. A mechanism of inorganic aerosol formation in a liquid phase, considered in the ISORROPIA/RIVAD+AQUA module was observed to exert strong influence on calculation results referring to concentration levels of some air contaminants. The following was found out: more than a double decrease of the annual average concentration of SO2, and even more significant increase (from 7 to 10 times) of the annual average concentration of PM10 (as a sum of primary and secondary particles) in comparison to other considered chemical transformation modules (MESOPUFF, RIVAD/ARM3, ISORROPIA/RIVAD), and a variant with a chemical transformation module switched off (without taking into account the secondary inorganic aerosol formation).},
